                        A 15-year-old gains spider-like abilities from a radioactive spider. Tom Holland was 
                        cast as Spider-Man after impressing producers with his roles in The Impossible, 
                        Wolf Hall, and In the Heart of the Sea. He aimed to bring a fresh take to the
                         character, balancing teenage issues with superhero duties. To prepare, Holland 
                         attended the Bronx High School of Science, where his anonymity mirrored Parker's.

                         Ned is a loyal and enthusiastic sidekick who discovers Peter's secret identity as 
                         Spider-Man early in the film. He provides comic relief, tech support, and moral 
                         support to Peter, often helping him with various superhero tasks and dilemmas.
                          Ned's friendship and assistance are crucial to Peter's journey as both a high school

                        fails. He's Liz's father, Peter Parker's love interest and a grounded villain, intended as a "regular guy" contrasting 
                        Spider-Man's "regular kid" persona. Director Jon Watts aimed for Toomes to avoid Avengers' 
                        attention and be a realistic foe for Peter Parker. Michael Keaton, playing Toomes, portrays
                         him as a family-driven "dark Tony Stark."

                         a future Spider-Man in the comics. Donald Glover, who voiced Morales in the Ultimate Spider-Man
                          TV series and campaigned to play Spider-Man in 2010, was cast by director Jon Watts as a treat
                           for fans. Davis mentions his nephew, hinting at Morales's potential future in the MCU. Watts 
                           insisted on Glover for the role, saying he would have removed Davis from the film if Glover
                            declined.

                        suggested Aunt May be a community organizer to reflect Peter's values.

                        Unlike the traditional white bully from the comics, Flash is reimagined as a rich, 
                        smug social media bully. Revolori, a Guatemalan American actor, received death threats 
                        upon his casting but worked hard to honor the character. Flash's rivalry with Peter
                         stems from jealousy over Peter's intelligence and popularity. Revolori gained 60 pounds for the role.

                        for Smoove after the writers and director enjoyed his performance alongside Holland

                        The former director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury, finds himself without his usual control. 
                        Director Jon Watts describes Fury's relationship with Parker as "the mean new stepdad,"
                         in contrast to Tony Stark's "supportive cool uncle" role. Fury views Parker as a valuable
                         asset distracted by high school issues. Initially, Watts pitched Fury as a mentor to Parker in Homecoming.

                        In "Spider-Man: No Way Home," Benedict Cumberbatch reprises his role as Dr. Stephen Strange,
                         acting more as a colleague than a mentor to Peter Parker. Cumberbatch sees a close bond between
                          them, though their relationship deteriorates over the film. Co-writer Chris McKenna describes
                           Strange as the voice of reason.
